# BigQuery SQL
Introduction to SQL

This is a series of exercises solved by **me** on Kaggle Summer Camp headed by Rachael Tatman. This series starts with beginner level and goes to intermediate and advanced. This also contains a sample BQML or BigQuery Machine Learning Tutorial to aid you with writing SQL queries to solve machine-learning problems faster and with ease.

It's free because you will use BigQuery SandBox for this workshop.

Enjoy and have fun!! :fire:
